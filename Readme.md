AXRToolset is an AutoHotkey & Lua-based scripting engine that utilizes a Graphical User Interface to display
scripted plugins that do various automated tasks. Although the current plugins are used in the aid of the development of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Chernobyl mod, the engine itself can be used to create macros, scripts and other utilities for any application or purpose.
